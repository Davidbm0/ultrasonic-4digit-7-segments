⭐ README 

This project represents my first steps into bare-metal development for the STM32 Nucleo-F303RE board. 
I started implementing low-level code without relying on HAL or high-level frameworks, focusing instead on direct register manipulation and gaining a deeper 
understanding of the microcontroller’s architecture.

The goal of this repository is to explore essential MCU features such as GPIO configuration, timers, interrupts, and clock setup, 
while building a clean and minimal bare-metal codebase. As the project evolves, modules will be added progressively, 
accompanied by clear documentation and improvements to structure and readability.

🔧 Current Progress
Initial project setup
Basic GPIO configuration
Implemented LED control on the board (turning the LED on/off and toggling it using direct register access)
Early experiments with register-level programming

📌 Planned Additions
System clock configuration
Timer and interrupt handling
UART communication
Better modular code organization
Detailed documentation for each peripheral

📁 About This Repository

This project serves both as a learning journey and as a reference for developers interested in bare-metal STM32 programming. 
All code prioritizes clarity, minimalism, and direct interaction with the hardware to offer a transparent view of how the microcontroller operates.
